Data structure and algorithms


computational problems
a cp defines a desired relationship between input and outout
each problem has domain
fore example sorting can be lines or people
an instance of a sorting problem would be a specific example
sorting problem is the prematation of the input so that we get an output where a1 < a2

relation between algorithms and computational problems
an algorithm is a way to solve a well declared computational problem
solving the generic version will result in creating a solution for each instance
searching
input : word,dictionary
output:definition

AL1: checking each page
Al2: checking two pages
Al3: halfing the dictionary log base 2

a program is an executable implementation of an algorithm
 thomas chapter 1

logical solution
a logical solution follows a set of rules or constraints or both


Lecuture 17th feb


coding is the process of instructing a computer so it performs a task
execution graph will be the coding
execution path
for/if/while are abstact illusion to represent the concepts

 asymptotic analysis


 Difficult question merge?
piecewise doesn't work


lecture

we will procede as usual for even it will be N/2 + 1
if we have x %3 =2 will be n/3


Lecture feb 22nd
keywords like break and continue and return we will estimate that they cost 0 time units
*** multilication and adiition have different values for time units
when calling your own function the complexity will be 1* complexity of the function individually

Data structure
 is the arrangement of data in memory RAM
 array is a data structure.
kernal will alocate memory for the application callled virtual memory address
	var arr[10] int // wll cost 1 time unit
    when stored on the actual ram the blocks might not be  attached
hardware makes the O() of retrieving 1
    lab 2

//delete O(n)
//insert O(n)
//scannins O(n)
//update O(1)
//search O(n)
