Data structure and algorithms


computational problems
a cp defines a desired relationship between input and outout
each problem has domain
fore example sorting can be lines or people
an instance of a sorting problem would be a specific example
sorting problem is the prematation of the input so that we get an output where a1 < a2

relation between algorithms and computational problems
an algorithm is a way to solve a well declared computational problem
solving the generic version will result in creating a solution for each instance
searching
input : word,dictionary
output:definition

AL1: checking each page
Al2: checking two pages
Al3: halfing the dictionary log base 2

a program is an executable implementation of an algorithm
 thomas chapter 1

logical solution
a logical solution follows a set of rules or constraints or both

coding is the process of instructing a computer so it performs a task
execution graph will be the coding
execution path
for/if/while are abstact illusion to represent the concepts
